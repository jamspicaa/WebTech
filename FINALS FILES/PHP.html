<h2>PHP</h2>
<p>The PHP Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) allows web developers to create dynamic content that communicates with the databases. PHP is basically used for developing web based software applications. </p>

<p>PHP started as a small project that evolved and more people found out how useful it was. Rasmus Lerdorf unleashed the first version of PHP way back in 1994. </p>
<p>PHP is a recursive acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor". </p>
<p>It is used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites. </p>
<p>It is integrated with a number of popular databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server. </p>
<p>PHP is pleasingly zippy in its execution, especially when compiled as an Apache module on the Unix side. The MySQL server, once started, executes even very complex queries with huge result sets in record-setting time. </p>
<p>PHP supports a large number of major protocols such as POP3, IMAP, and LDAP. PHP4 added support for Java and distributed object architectures (COM and CORBA), making n-tier development a possibility for the first time. </p>

<h2>Common uses of PHP</h2>
<p>PHP performs system functions, i.e. from files on a system it can create, open, read, write, and close them. </p>
<p>PHP can handle forms, i.e. gather data from files, save data to a file, through email you can send data, return data to the user. </p>
<p>Adding, deleting and modifying elements within the database through PHP.
Access cookies variables and set cookies. </p>
<p>Using PHP, you can restrict users to access some pages of your website.It can encrypt data. </p>

<h2>Characteristics of PHP</h2>
	<p>Five important characteristics make PHP's practical nature possible</p>
			<p>Simplicity</p>
			<p>Efficiency</p>
			<p>Security</p>
			<p>Flexibility</p>
			<p>Familiarity</p>

<h2>The main way to store information in the middle of a PHP program is by using a variable. </h2>

<h3>Here are the most important things to know about variables in PHP.</h3>
		<p>All variables in PHP are denoted with a leading dollar sign ($).</p>
		<p>The value of a variable is the value of its most recent assignment. </p>
		<p>Variables are assigned with the = operator, with the variable on the left-hand side and the expression to be evaluated on the right. </p>
		<p>Variables can, but do not need, to be declared before assignment. </p>
		<p>Variables in PHP do not have intrinsic types - a variable does not know in advance whether it will be used to store a number or a string of characters. </p>
		<p>Variables used before they are assigned have default values. </p>
		<p>PHP does a good job of automatically converting types from one to another when necessary. </p>
		<p>PHP variables are Perl-like. </p>

<h3>PHP has a total of eight data types which we use to construct our variables </h3>
		<p>Integers − are whole numbers, without a decimal point, like 4195. </p>
		<p>Doubles − are floating-point numbers, like 3.14159 or 49.1. </p>
		<p>Booleans − have only two possible values either true or false. </p>
		<p>NULL − is a special type that only has one value: NULL. </p>
		<p>Strings − are sequences of characters, like 'PHP supports string operations.'</p>
		<p>Arrays − are named and indexed collections of other values. </p>
		<p>Objects − are instances of programmer-defined classes, which can package up both other kinds of values and functions that are specific to the class. </p>
		<p>Resources − are special variables that hold references to resources external to PHP (such as database connections). </p>

<h2>A few "magical" PHP constants are given below</h2>
	<h3>LINE</h3>
		<p>The current line number of the file. </p>

	<h3>FILE</h3>
		<p>The full path and filename of the file. If used inside an include,the name of the included file is returned. Since PHP 4.0.2, __FILE__always contains an absolute path whereas in older versions it contained relative path under some circumstances. </p>

	<h3>FUNCTION</h3>
		<p>The function name. (Added in PHP 4.3.0) As of PHP 5 this constant returns the function name as it was declared (case-sensitive). In PHP 4 its value is always lowercased. </p>

	<h3>CLASS</h3>
		<p>The class name. (Added in PHP 4.3.0) As of PHP 5 this constant returns the class name as it was declared (case-sensitive). In PHP 4 its value is always lowercased. </p>

	<h3>METHOD</h3>
		<p>The class method name. (Added in PHP 5.0.0) The method name is returned as it was declared (case-sensitive). </p>

<h2>Common Associative Arrays</h2>
		<h3>$_POST</h3>
				<p>fields from form tags</p>
		<h3>$_GET</h3>
				<p>fields from URL arguments</p>
		<h3>$_SERVER</h3>
				<p>common system-oriented information</p>
		<h3>$_COOKIES</h3>
				<p>fields from browser cookies</p>
		<h3>$_SESSION</h3>
				<p>fields for user authentication</p>
		<h3>$GLOBALS</h3>
				<p>all global variables</p>
